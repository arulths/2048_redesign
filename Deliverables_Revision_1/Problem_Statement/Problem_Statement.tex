\textcolor{red}{What problem are you trying to solve?}\\
It is commonly known that technology, although serving countless purposes, is a large source of distraction to many people. More specifically, online applications, although highly entertaining and addicting, are very limited in cognitive stimulation. This is highly problematic as we are enabling a culture of absent minded technological engagement. \par \vspace{5mm}

\textcolor{red}{Why is this an important problem?}\\
According to Jane McGonigal, a well known and world renowned game designer; we spend 3 billion hours a week playing video games. That is a lot of time that many people argue could be spent better, and that is what 2048 aims to accomplish. More and more people are playing video games everyday and 2048 is a fun and challenging game that tests the users' mathematical as well as their spatial intelligence. This allows 2048 to be fun, yet still be brain enhancing. \par \textcolor{red}{Since our primary stakeholders will be the customers (i.e. the gamers), giving them another option to a game that is both fun and intellectually challenging will allow them to make better use of their time. Furthermore, in this time and era, video games have become a big part of our daily lives as stated earlier, and giving the customers the option to spend their gaming time in a way that is beneficial to them is why this game is of importance to the stakeholders(gamers). } \par \vspace{5mm}

\textcolor{red}{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}\\
Everyone experiences idle time in their day; this could be waiting for an appointment, a class, a bus or for friends. This game is intended to appeal to everyone looking for a more entertaining way to spend their idle time. The complexity of the game is meant to provide a challenge so that the user does not feel like they are wasting time, but using their time constructively. 
The game will be playable on all of the three major operating systems, OSX, Windows, and Linux with possible future expansion to mobile devices. \vspace{10mm}
